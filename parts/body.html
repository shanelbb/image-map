        <p class="description">The body of an acoustic guitar is made up of the soundboard, or top, and the back and sides. The soundboard is the part that vibrates to produce sound, which is why top tonewoods are considered so important, but the back and sides contribute to the tone as well (read more about how top vs. back and sides affect tone in our article “Your Tone Begins with Your Top”). From top to bottom, the body is divided into the upper bout, the waist, and the lower bout. Bouts are measured across the width of the guitar, with the lower bout being slightly larger than the upper bout.</p>
        <p class="description">
            There are many types of guitar body sizes and shapes, including models with cutaways, or scooped indentations in the guitar’s upper, treble-side bout (the treble side is the side of the first string). In general, a bigger box means a bigger sound, but some guitars will surprise you with qualities not typical to their body style.
