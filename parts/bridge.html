        <p class="description">The bridge of the guitar supports the strings and transmits their vibration to the soundboard. Strings produce a very low sound on their own because they displace only a tiny volume of air as they vibrate. The vibration of strings therefore needs to be conducted to a larger, resonant surface, and a bridge is the usual way of achieving this on stringed instruments. Bridges may consist of a single material, usually wood for acoustic guitars, or they may be made of several parts and include other materials such as plastic or bone. On classical and steel string guitars, the bridge is glued to the top.</p>
