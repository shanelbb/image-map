        <p class="description">The dots you see on a guitar fretboard are to help the guitarist easily find any position on the fretboard. The dots are a quick visual guide to make it easier for guitarists to jump to any fret position. Without any dots or markers on the fretboard, it can be tricky to quickly find the correct fret. You have to count the frets from the open string to find the right position, which is very slow to do. While guitarists eventually learn to find the frets by feel, fretboard markers make the job a lot easier. If a guitar uses dots or markers on the fretboard, you can quickly learn to find any fret position.</p>
